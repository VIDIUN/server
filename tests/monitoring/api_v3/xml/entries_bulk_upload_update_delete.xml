<!-- 

This is a *generic* example of Vidiun's bulk upload XML. 

To enable more advanced content ingestion options, this example can be extended to include
multiple/custom metadata items, account specific settings, update action and advanced content 
ingestion options (e.g. ingestion of multiple transcoding flavors, multiple thumbnails etc.)


Every item element within this xml represents a single entry created in the publisher account. 
Each entry will be populated with the metadata listed in its item element and the content referenced from it.

When submitted, the bulk upload xml is validated on the Vidiun server. 
The validation includes an inspection of the XML structure, and verification of 
elements' structure and order compliance with Vidiun's bulk upload XSD (XML schema). 
When a validation error is detected, specific error description is avaialble in the 
"Bulk Upload Log" page in the VMC. Access this page through the content tab in the 
VMC main navigation: Content > Uploads Control > Switch to Bulk Upload Log

The commented-out elements within this example are placeholders for some 
advanced/account specific options.  A description of all supported elements and 
attributes, as well as a download of the full bulk upload XML schema are available on Vidiun's XML Schema pages 
at: http://www.vidiun.com/api_v3/xsdDoc/?type=bulkUploadXml.bulkUploadXML
